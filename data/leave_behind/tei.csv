After President Grant gave his opening address, the signal was given to unfurl and raise every flag and insignia simultaneously on the entire fairground. A chorus of one thousand began to sing, accompanied by an orchestra and chimes, and the barrage of one hundred rifles symbolized a century of independence for the United States of America (McCabe). This was the first major international world's fair in North America, and while many foreigners argued the United States did not have anything to show, the country shone through displaying its growth into a major industrial power.","Fair Centennial Exhibition (1876 : Philadelphia, Pa.), , Art & Architecture Libraries",,Katie Chiles,,,,University of Maryland Libraries,,North America|United States of America|Maryland|College Park,2 image,"Centennial Exhibition (1876: Philadelphia, Pa.)|Advertising cards|Exhibitions.

The program, which Time Saver Guidebooks sold for five cents, included all of the events that were scheduled to take place on that day, a few articles about the most popular attractions, and advertisements for restaurants and hotels in the area. The colors of the program are dull and dark, and the layout is simple. The map itself depicts all of the major buildings that hosted events or popular exhibits. A bird's eye view however, is an artistic rendering, and therefore does not necessarily have to be correct. This particular image was found in a pamphlet called ""Pan-American Exposition, Buffalo 1901"", which featured many brilliantly colored pictures of the fair, as well as a brief background and summary of events. The image is approximately twelve inches by eight inches and takes up two pages of the pamphlet. The original drawing for the bird's eye view was drawn by the office of Carr??re & Hastings, and was edited by Harry Fenn.

The original idea was to have a theme center, with twin 250 feet towers and a semicircular hall to display dioramas. Wallace K. Harrison, a prominent New York architect of the Harrison Fouilhoux firm, was selected to design the theme center in November 1936. Harrison wanted a design that would represent a new architecture concept. In his own words, ""we found ourselves constantly referring to the domes and campaniles of Venice, perhaps because the flat country and water of the Fair grounds are very like that of the site of Venice and in addition the sky color of New York is practically the same."" (Newhouse,82) The idea of a large dome was a starting point for all further designs, and many different ideas were initially developed. There were plans to use a sphere that was suspended by steel cables, giving it a light, airy feel as well as a large balloon, anchored by steel cables and accessible by elevator. A spherical design was not a new idea, however. An earlier example of such a design was proposed by Etienne-Louis Boull??e in his project for Newton's Cenotaph in 1783, featuring a huge sphere at the center. In the end a design that featured a sphere 200 feet in diameter raised on pillars was selected. Despite its huge dimensions, with a 200-foot diameter, it was hard to grasp the exact scale of the sphere. Harrison and his design team finally came up with the idea of using a tall spike to frame the sphere, but there was still the problem of placing the two in relation with each other. They found inspiration from drawings by a Soviet constructivist architect named Jacob Tchernikhov, which represented two large spheres connected to a tall spike by way of a ramp.","Fair New York World's Fair (1939-1940), , Art & Architecture Libraries",,James Yu,,,,University of Maryland Libraries,,North America|United States of America|Maryland|College Park,3 image,"New York World's Fair (1939-1940)|Trylon.

With all the skill that could be mustered by American engineers, an island was constructed amidst the Pacific waters, becoming the largest ever manmade island. Christened Treasure Island, this would be the location of the 1939 Exhibition. The visions of a fair surrounded by the glory of the Pacific Ocean had finally materialized. However, this captivating scene took place as Europe verged on the edge of disaster. Germany had already begun its annexation of neighboring countries and threatened to unleash conflict on a global level. In only two short years the United States would be fully involved in this catastrophe. Furthermore, at the time of the fair the United States had just emerged from the Great Depression, which had affected the country in many ways. This fair seemed to provide a brief interlude between these two very difficult times in American history. For this event the U.S. decided to turn attention away from the international climate and focus on the beauty of the Pacific, which ironically is named for peace.","Fair Golden Gate International Exposition (1939-1940 : San Francisco, Calif.), , Art & Architecture Libraries",,Anna Burrows,,,,University of Maryland Libraries,,North America|United States of America|Maryland|College Park,1 image,"Moulin, Gabriel, 1872-1945|Golden Gate International Exposition (1939-1940 : San Francisco, Calif.)|Exhibitions|1901-2000|Essay|Architecture, Landscape, Historic Places",eng,,,,umd_1010/umd_2187/tei.xml

The Third Republic was established in Paris in 1870, and by 1884, when preliminary studies for the the Exposition Universelle were launched, many political issues were still largely unresolved. In 1870 Napoleon III surrendered at the Battle of Sedan during the Franco-Prussian War. Two days after the defeat Republicans proclaimed the advent of the Third Republic. The Franco-Prussian war ended with Paris's capitulation in 1871. A group of Parisians found Prussia's terms humiliating and wanted to keep fighting. Later dubbed the Communards, they established a dictatorship in Paris known as the Central Committee of the National Guard, later renamed La Commune. However, before La Commune could put its principles into effect, The National Assembly sent troops into Paris to eradicate the uprising. Even with the elimination of La Commune, there was great dissention within the government. There were conflicts between and within the Left and Right movements. An economic depression began in France in 1873 and worsened into the 1880s, affecting agriculture, industry, and small-scale trade. Citizen unrest was clearly evident in the popularity of General Georges Boulanger, who promised a reform, if not revolution, of the existing government. In 1888, when Boulanger was at the height of his political esteem, the threat of governmental crisis was very palpable.","Fair Exposition universelle de 1889 (Paris, France), , Art & Architecture Libraries",,Ly Y.

It boasted new architectural styles, as well as the more generous use of electricity in the pavilions. In the earliest world's fairs, all the displays were housed collectively under one roof. This eventually changed to a different type of organization, where exhibits were separated into categories based on their content, as was already the case at the 1873 Vienna exhibition. At the 1876, 1878 and 1889 fairs, countries presented their own individual pavilions. While at first the international community seemed a bit hesitant to participate in a fair meant to celebrate a Revolution, many countries decided to participate and erect a special pavilion. Countries such as Japan, Siam, Persia, Turkey, Russia, Greece, as well as many Latin American nations presented national exhibits. When the 1889 Paris Exhibition is first mentioned, most people immediately think of the construction of the famed Eiffel Tower. This striking monument, enhanced with nighttime lights, brought the admiration of many and earned itself a place as a permanent fixture and international symbol for Paris. The fair was known for its impressively modern constructions of iron and glass, such as Machinery Hall. The pavilion for the Principality of Monaco can be noted at this fair, not for its grand scale or modern appeal, but for its delicate return to a classic style which turned attention to a small, yet sophisticated nation. Its proximity to the Eiffel tower symbolized the ongoing relationship between France and Monaco.","Fair Exposition universelle de 1889 (Paris, France), , Art & Architecture Libraries",,Anna Burrows,,,,University of Maryland Libraries,,North America|United States of America|Maryland|College Park,1 image,"Paris World's Fair (1889)|Monaco Building.

The successes of the 1876 Philadelphia and 1889 Paris fairs drove the Chicago planners to produce something even greater. As stated by Richard Wilson, the Paris fair especially hit home for the Americans. The sheer magnificence of the buildings and exhibits made the United States look very backward indeed. While France and the rest of the Old World countries held their own with remarkable advances in art, architecture, and science, the U.S. appeared to be falling behind. America's relatively inferior showings didn't help to shake this harsh image. The U.S. was desperate for a new self-image. It needed an opportunity to establish itself as the superpower it felt it deserved to be. The Columbian Exposition gave the U.S. this chance. Fair organizers planned the fair on a grand scale. They gravitated towards a solemn Neo-Classical style, as exemplified in the all-white Court of Honor, a style which represented order, tradition, purity, and grandeur -- all the things that America was trying to display.","Fair World's Columbian Exposition (1893 : Chicago, Ill.), , Art & Architecture Libraries",,Ricardo Gonzalez,,,,University of Maryland Libraries,,North America|United States of America|Maryland|College Park,1 image,"World's Columbian Exposition (1893 : Chicago, Ill.)|Libbey Inc.|Ferris wheels|Exhibition buildings|1801-1900|Essay|Architecture, Landscape, Historic Places",eng,,,,umd_996/umd_2196/tei.xml

As the main exhibit space of the fair, it was the largest building ever constructed at the time and the most visited site at the exposition. The general scheme for the building was laid out during the early planning stages of the Chicago fair. It was to be located facing Lake Michigan on its long axis and the east end of the Court of Honor, where the other main buildings were grouped, on its short axis. Architect John Wellborn Root, partner of fair director Daniel Burnham, devised the basic function for the building. Because Root died early in the planning stages, the program was radically altered by his successor Charles Atwood. The latter's idea for a clear span surrounded by galleries prevailed, as fair organizers were intent to surpass that of the famous Galerie des Machines at the Paris exposition of 1889. New York architect George B. Post (1837-1913) was chosen to design the Manufactures building from a group of mostly eastern architects selected for the major fair buildings, including Richard Morris Hunt and McKim, Mead and White. His experience in large classically detailed New York buildings such as the Produce Exchange (1881-84) and the Havemeyer Building (1891-93), both demolished, made him a good candidate to uphold the White City ideal of the fair, emphasizing classical canons of composition and ornamentation.

In particular, it is reflected in the Baroness’s commentary on Germany (which she equated with stultifying restriction) and America (which she associated with dynamic freedom). In 1923, after Little Review stopped publishing her work, the Baroness concluded that she was not appreciated in New York. She wrote to Barnes, “I have not become ‘known enough’ and so I am forgotten,” because “I had fame that kept me admired, jeered at, feared, and poor” (“Selections” 25, 26). As a result— with a loan from William Carlos Williams—Freytag-Loringhoven returned to Germany only to discover that her father had disinherited her. Until 1926, she was despondent, selling newspapers on the street in Berlin until Barnes and others raised enough money to send her to Paris where she subsequently died. In post-war Berlin, the Baroness often reflected on what she looked back on as happier times in the states. Written during this period, the first lines of “Statements/Purgatory Lilt” reflect her opinion of Germany: ""GERMANY’S REMAIN IS PERMEATED BY DECAY REEK THROUGHOUT. / EFFECT OF BRAINSTORMING BACKSLIDE—"" while the poem concludes with her more hopeful perspective on America, which she has left behind forever. The concluding lines discuss the stifling air (“wheeze I”) the Baroness perceives in the atmosphere of post-war Germany. Germany’s architecture and its “ghosts” or culture is decaying, while in the “sweet soil” of America, she might take root and conceivably flourish. In an undated letter to Djuna Barnes from Germany she writes of her love for America: IT IS ‘LIFE’ THERE—DOING—EVEN IF IN DEFIANCE OF MENTAL POVERTY BENEATH MASK OF GENIUS—FOR THE SAKE OF “MAKING A LIVING.” IT IS PLUCK! IT IS LIFE! THE GERMAN IS NOT EVEN CAPABLE OF IT! HE IS IN TRADITION ROTTEN SCHRUNKEN DIGNITY A DAPPER GRAVE—EXHAUSTED FOOL—WHO DIES OF “CONVICTION” WITHOUT TO KNOW WHAT ABOUT—HE HAS BECOME TOO COMFORTABLY DULL—HAS FORGOTTEN TO MOVE—FIGHT—EXCEPT IN THAT MECHANICAL WAR FASHION WITH WEAPONS (UMD). Reflecting a Dadaist sensibility, the Baroness loves America because she perceives it is a culture not so mired in “dull,” no longer meaningful, traditions like those represented in many “old-world” religions. She perceives that it is a culture of action, a trait she admires. In an another undated letter to Djuna Barnes, the Baroness writes, ""COULD YOU NOT BRING THAT -- WHAT I TITLED ""HELL'S WISDOM""?

For copyright reasons, this additional version of the poem is not included here. This poem is playful, making ribald reference to condoms as ""dandy celluloid tubes . . . tinted diabolically as a baboon's hind-complexion"" and ""the vibrator-- -- -- /Coy flappertoy!"" She also includes a section with a thinly-veiled praise for her heterosexuality: . . . I don't hanker after Billyboys-- but I am entitled To be deeply shocked. So are we-- but you fill the hiatus.Dear-- I ain't queer-- I need it straight -- --A dozen cocktails-- please-- -- -- --She plays with the reader as she plays with herself: sexual freedom makes sex an arena of play and self-empowerment. The play here on ""deeply shocked"" both indicates an offense of social conscience and, especially coupled with the next line ""but you fill the hiatus,"" a sexual penetration. She used the attention generated by this ""obscene"" language to make pointed social commentaries. In ""A Dozen Cocktails—Please,"" for example, she criticizes what she perceives as American social inferiorities by criticizing its bathroom habits. At a phase in her career when she argues for European artistic and aristocratic superiority, she denigrates the ""uppity"" Americans who, while socially barbarous, have advanced and expensive bathroom amenities:What's the dread Matter with the up-to-date-American- Home-comforts? Bum insufficient for theShould-be wellgroomed upsy! Liberty is restrictive, however; it demands a level of censorship to which the Baroness (in the words of Pound's Cantos) was ""non-acquiescent."" It is her non-acquiescence, her inclination to be too obscene, too critical, which left her without a readership at The Little Review. Especially as a woman, the Baroness's sense of freedom of expression, which makes her work valuable posthumously helped to situate her on the fringe in her time. One technique that demanded an active audience was ""optophonetic"" poetry, which provided a written form for the very popular ""sound poetry"" that Dadaists Tzar, Huelsenbeck, Janco and others performed at the Cabaret Voltaire. In his desire to abstract language, Dadaist Raol Haussman created notations that used typographic variations to signal certain sound effects, essentially designing a system much like musical notation. Kurt Schwitters followed behind, creating what he called Merz or a multi-genre, multi-media poem that incorporated optophonetics with pictures, nails, and even sentences, often cut from the newspaper or a pamphlet. The Baroness, who was much enraged by Schwitters' rising popularity with The Little Review during the years of her decline from their favor, incorporates optophonetics in her own work, more in the Schwitters fashion. In her manuscripts, there is evidence that she experimented with using optophonetics as one element among many that render meaning in a poem. In ""A Dozen Cocktails Please,"" she writes: ""Serpentine aircurrents -- -- --/Hhhhhphssssssss! The very word penetrates."" The word, with its low-slung ""p"" in the middle and its swerving queue of ""s"" evokes the penetrating snake that it mimics.",Office of Digital Collections and Research,,Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven,,,,Tanya Clement,,North America|United States of America|Maryland|College Park,3 image; 54 line; 3 witness,"Literature, Print Culture",eng,,,,umd_55430/umd_55431/tei.xml

The Baroness experienced a syphylitic outbreak while still in Germany in 1896 (see Irene Gammel's Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada, and Everday Modernity pgs. 69-71) the soure of which she attributed to genetic inheritance. Though the poem rests blame squarely on the father, it also implies some culpability in the mother's desire for this ""slick"" man. The notion that her sicknesses and weaknesses —whether physical or pyschological— are inherited from her mother surfaces repeatedly in her letters to Djuna Barnes. In one undated letter, the Baroness claims, ""MY MOTHER SINNED AGAINST ME—FOR HAVING MADE ME—HER HEIR —WICH [sic] WAS BRILLIANT — BUT INSUFFICIENT —UNPROVIDED WITH CIRCUMSPECTION. SOMEBODY HAS TO LOOK OUT FOR ME — ALWAYS — IN OUTER MANAGEMENT. I NEVER MANAGED AT —ALL—I KNEW I COULDN'T —I TRUSTED IN ""GOD"" — ALWAYS! AS MY MOTHER DID —"" (UMD 2.263). In addition, the Baroness used this metaphor of inheritance to describe the affect that German sensibilities had on her artistic work, a discussion of which is included in the introduction to ""Orgasmic Toast""Much like the language used in ""A Dozen Cocktails, Please,"" ""Ancestry"" uses coloquial and slang terms for describing sexual parts and actions. In part these words allow her to tap into the vulgarity and humor in her situation, which was somewhat common in the bohemian crowd in which she moved. A the same time, these popular and vulagar words and phrases represent the only language one would use to express these ideas in poetry that was meant to reach a broad audience. In another undated letter to Barnes, the Baroness describes wanting to ""curse"" as a result of her frustration in attempting to work on a poem of hers in which the progression of versions is confusing even though the pages are numbered. In the note she admits that ""sailor language"" is compelling, a fact that means she will never be widely read by, presumably, a literary audience: BE CAREFUL IN READING NOT TO MIX NUMBERS UP TOO MUCH AS I DID WITH SHEETS - ON ACCOUNT OF THAT DAMNED WET INK AND NO ""LICKPAPER"" (LO:SCHPAPIER) [GERMAN WORD] BEST IS - TO TURN EVERY PAGE OTHER SIDE -SOME ARE WRITTEN ON - SOME NOT BUT NUMBERS FOLLOW RIGHT!

Café du Dôme in Montparnasse, Paris was a favorite stopping place for Parisians and expatriates during the twenties. In the Baroness’s writings, it represents a site in Paris where all types of marginalized identities such as artists, writers, bisexuals and trans-sexuals could meet and greet alongside tourists and common Parisians. The Café encapsulates this network of personalities but so does Marcel Duchamp whose personality the Baroness gestures toward here with the opposing images of ""Mike"" (the common man), ""marcelled"" (the highly coiffed and pampered man), ""Saint Kyk"" (both elevated and denigrated) and ""Garcon!"" (the object of the poem but a boy mean to cater to her demands). Needless to say, the Baroness’s feelings towards Duchamp were conflicted. She both admired him for his innovative and experimental art and abhorred him for his widespread success, which brought him both recognition and monetary rewards: ""MARCEL,"" she writes in an undated letter to Djuna Barnes, ‘IS PERMITTETD TO DO ART – WITHOUT HAVING POVERTY SQUEEZE HIS WIND PIPE –AND OTHERS – SO MANY - MANY!!!"" (UMD 2.320). THESE THEMES ARE ALSO PREVALENT IN THE SHORT AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL PIECE THE BARONESS INCLUDES ON THE BACK OF VERSION 2 OF THE POEM IN WHICH SHE RECOUNTS AN INCIDENT WITH HER EX-HUSBAND ""FELIX"" (CANADIAN WRITER FELIX PAUL GROVE) WHERE HE REPRIMANDS HER FOR HER ""SUNDAY"" ATTITUDE OR FRIVOLOUSNESS AND HER DESIRE TO BUY ""FURS AND HATS"" (HER ""FRIPPERY"") WHILE SHE DESPISES HIM FOR HIS MANIKIN-LIKE WORK-ETHIC, HIS ""POUNDING"" AND ""CLICK CLICK CLICK"" ON THE TYPEWRITER. THE CAFÉ REPRESENTS THE DICHOTOMY (""UN PNEUMATIC CROSS"") THE BARONESS PERCEIVED BETWEEN THE DECADENT OR ENRICHED LIFE AN ARTIST MUST EXPERIENCE IN ORDER TO PRODUCE HER ART (""IT IS ALWAYS SUNDAY -"" THE NARRATOR SAYS TO FELIX, ""IT MUST BE - HOW SHALL I LIVE"") AND THE MONEY ONE MUST EARN IN ORDER TO AFFORD SUCH AMENITIES AND EXPERIENCES. The Baroness mentions the Café in one other short prose piece that bears some relevancy both to the context in which the poem was published (alongside ""Xray"") and to the themes in the poem discussed above. This prose piece is written on the back of a pamphlet for a Man Ray exhibit called ""Peintures de Kiki"" which featured paintings of Alice Prin, Man Ray’s lover in the 1920s. The piece is written in two versions, the second of which I include here: ""IT IS NICE HE GIRL- SHE MAN – WHENEVER I ENTER IN FAMOUS DOME TO WHOM HAPPENS- AS TO ME GIFTED WITH XRAY ORBS OF SORRY SORT CLAIRVOYANCE THROUGH HIS ATTIRE OBSERVING IT - THIS PHENOMENON HAPPENS THIS PHENOMENON: LIKE AS IN THOUGH MY FEAR OF UNEXPECTED DISCHARGE BY SUDDEN FIT OF DARRHEEADIARRHEA -- HE UP PURSES HIS ARSHOLE BY FEARTHOUGHT OF HAVING TO UNPURSE HIS PURSE.

Likewise, the Baroness was interested in precision that science and technology afforded. ""Cosmic Arithmetic,"" in its mathematic articulation of culturally significant words such as ""sex,"" ""potency,"" and ""Holy Ghost"" is appealing to the modernist and dadaist need for expressing abstract truths with concision. In ""An Introduction to Dada"" Tristan Tzara writes that ""Dada was born of a moral need, an implacable will to achieve a moral absolute, of a profound sentiment that man, at the center of all creations of the spirit, must affirm his primacy over notions emptied of all human substance, over dead objects and ill-gotten gains"" [in The Dada Painters and Poets: An Anthology, edited by Robert Motherwell (New York: Geroge Wittenborn, Inc., 1951): 394]. Likewise, this poem seeks to understand the moral absolute of the trinity of the Holy Ghost by representing that trinity in the conciseness that numbers can convey. At the same time, numbers are abstract, and by equating the same numerical combinations (2 + 1 = 3) with terms such as ""sex"" and ""potency"" or power, the Baroness is interrogating the ""absolute"" morality that the holy trinity (the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost) represent. In other words, traditionally, ""father"" and ""son"" is a relationship marked by cultural negotiations between power and sex. Where does this relationship exist within the holy trinity? Like ""Matter Level Perspective"" and ""Orchard Farming"" and in which the Baroness uses lines in addition to words to represent meaning, ""Cosmic Arithmetic"" seems influenced both by other experiments in abstraction like the typographical experiments of Tzara and Raul Hausmann and also Francis Picabia’s and Marcel Duchamp’s machine drawings.",Office of Digital Collections and Research,,Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven,,,,Tanya Clement,,North America|United States of America|Maryland|College Park,2 image; 3 line; 2 witness,"Literature, Print Culture",eng,,,,umd_55439/umd_55440/tei.xml

The reader is essentially given license to read the poem in different ways, a point that is highlighted when considering Irene Gammel’s very different reading of “Matter Level Perspective” in which the form is a body with a head and the spirals resemble sperm-like lines instead of cathode rays. The interplay of scientific and creative forces in this poem, however, also point to themes inspired by Freytag-Loringhoven’s fellow Dadaists. For Dadaists and modernists alike, science and technology functioned in opposition to the elements of chance that were associated with creative impulse. Indeed, technological precision is at the heart of Duchamp’s Large Glass, for which he took meticulous notes on the mathematical and geometric dimensions of the piece. In writing math equations for her poem ""Hell’s Wisdom,"" the Baroness wrote to Barnes that the poem is ""cristall [sic]"" in the ""conciseness"" of its ""arithmetic."" Likewise, the Baroness was interested in precision that science and technology afforded. ""Matter Level Perspective"" appears much like a diagram meant to represent moving parts in which words such as ""immured,"" ""craft,"" and ""spirit"" are simply points on an unbroken line in motion. Here, the words are used to emphasize the movement of the lines much like in the machine drawings that Picabia drew for 391 and the Zurich magazine Dada in 1919 and in a special Picabia edition of The Little Review in 1922, in addition to the sketches that Marcel Duchamp used in his notes for The Large Glass. In ""Matter Level Perspective,"" the Baroness uses sketches that resemble an early Cathode X-Ray tube. The poem begins with ""matter"" from the ""Matter Level Perspective"" and continues through the coils or ""spiral"" of ""life"" and ""art"" before coming together as ""spirit"" and ""craft,"" but then the break down of these essential elements into their particle and electromagnetic state is the result of the poems movement through the ""cathedral,"" which functions not only as a play on the word ""cathode"" and as a comment on the negative affect that institutionalized religion (symbolized by the institution’s edifice itself) has on the spirit and therefore one’s craft but also on the ""catholic"" rigor of the scientific method for breaking a human down into her particle parts. At the end of the poem, we find the word ""immured"" trapped and contained in a ""circle container"" as waves that are still embodied within the circle, but are disembodied from their original ""perspective"" or form and in danger of being released and therefore disintegrated into the world. The first page of the first version has the number ""2"" written in the upper right-hand corner as if it the ""final version"" had been sent somewhere. In any case, it does nto exist in the manuscript archive. Perhaps, the Baroness sent the poem to Djuna Barnes. It is mentioned in the following letter to Barnes, dated between 1924 and 1927: . . .

The ""warlock"" implies a god-like figure who makes man ""in rapt clay,"" in his likeness (with his ""mien""). The protagonist is a like a Greek god, sitting above with a ""chalice"" in hand, but he is also the source of science with the bottom of his uplifted chalice becoming an ""omnipulsespun cristaline disc"" or the sun. Here the Baroness employs the mathematical components she has also introduced in ""Cosmic Arithmetic"", which correspond to the two kinds of trinities: the father, the son, and the Holy Ghost and Sex, Potency, and the Holy Ghost. This transition seems to come from the reference to the ""sun""--a link which is made in the Sixth version where she plays with ""son's orgasm"" and ""sun's orgasm."" In ""Orgasmic Toast,"" she also uses the snake metaphor which she draws in ""Sermon on Life's Beggar Truth"", ""sounds out"" in ""A Dozen Cocktails Please"", and which also appears in a fragment on the verso of a version of ""Christ - Don Quixote - St. George"". In a letter to Barnes, she explains at length that the snake represents her unwanted desire to commit suicide, a desire she calls ""unnatural"" versus her ""natural"" state as ""artist."" She likens being an ""artist"" with ""life"" (being alive) and the snake with the ""spectre"" of death. With the snake, she draws on themes of inheritance that she has employed in ""Ancestry"" that are linked to her misgivings about her return to Germany, which she discusses in ""Purgatory Lilt/Statements of Circumstanced Me"". Ultimately, she believes that Germany stultifies her, giving her a ""spiritual cancer of womb"" that halts her ability to write, to produce ""mind children."" In this way, the Baroness ties the institutional factions (religion) and familial ties (her mother, who was given syphyllis by her father) to the ""serpentine current"" (""A Dozen Cocktails Please"") that ""pricks"" (""Ancestry"") her and gives her this cancer. Germany is therefore representative of the social and (necessarily) gendered restrictions that the Baroness believed hindered her success as a ""popular writer"" (see discussion of ""Ancestry"").I AGE HERE!

Eugene Jolas’s piece “Logos” begins on the page after the Baroness’s poem. He begins the piece: “Poetry is at the cross-roads today,” and he goes on to define this crossroads as one between a “positivist” and “sterile” poetry that gives a “monotonous description” of a “mediocre universe” and experimental poetry that seeks to revise “traditional” values and is “in open revolt against naturalistic concepts” (25). These are concepts already expressed in magazines such as The Little Review and others, but like the editors of Dial and Poetry, Jolas inscribes a transcendental and otherworldly element to the poet by denigrating “verbal freaks and literary acrobatics” and postulating that the “orphic poet” has a vision that is “direct and pure.” This orphic poet, he contends, has to do with the world, but his poetry does not: “Poetry, using the word as mechanics, may [. . .] produce a metaphoric universe with is a sublimation of the physical world” (26). The piece serves as a warning to the dead author of the posthumously published poem that precedes it: poetry should have little to do with your life. Clearly, it seems that the experimental nature of the poem was what attracted Jolas to it. Thus, in the context of the published poem, the ttitle ""Ostentatious"" has less to do with the Baroness's well-known street performances and more to do with the more oymoronic because more subtle ostentatious element of the sky and the word in play. “Ostentatious; Westward:; Eastward:; Agog.” (transition June 1929, 24) relies on strictures of reading order and space to make meaning. In this compilation poem, the Baroness includes four separate poems. The first and topmost stanza, titled “Ostentatious” discusses “Vivid fall’s/Bugle sky;” the second to the right is titled “WESTWARD:”, while the next, lower to the left is titled “EASTWARD:”; the last stanza, at the bottom of the space, is titled “Agog” and discusses “Ultramarine/Avenues.” While the placement of the sky at the top and the water at the bottom provokes little thought, the displacement of East and West—in terms of mapping standards—is more curious. That these stanzas actually include the adverbial form “Eastward” and “Westward” indicates a missing verb and therefore a missing subject. This occlusion emphasizes the perspective of that missing subject. The “Eastward” stanza in the traditionally “West” (because on the far left) position is about what one views from the West looking Eastward: a rising moon in the East. Likewise, the “Westward” stanza in the traditionally “East” position is about the setting sun. The day is bright as a bugle at the highest point of the sky (at the top of the page). The sun begins to set in the “westward” looking perspective where the tones of the poem deepen (the golden saxophone). As the day wanes or as the reader moves down the page in traditional reading order, however, the moon rises towards the East, and it seems that travesty prevails: from the centered perspective of the sea, the sun and the moon are both risen; resembling two eyes widened in shock, these eyes are “Agog” at the world. The tone and meaning of each word is dependent on the reader’s movement through the graphical interface or the space on the page. Space is an essential element within the poem with which the Baroness was working. Indeed, in the first of the four manuscript versions of “Ostentatious,” the words of the text change little while their movement in the space on the page changes dramatically, emphasizing the fact that the Baroness anticipates the reader’s ordered movement through space as a signifying element in the poem.",Office of Digital Collections and Research,,Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven,,,,Tanya Clement,,North America|United States of America|Maryland|College Park,7 image; 25 line; 7 witness,"Literature, Print Culture",eng,,,,umd_55449/umd_55450/tei.xml

""Sermon on Life's Beggar Truth"" is a prose-poem with wave-like, seemingly unfettered, bouts of prose interspersed throughout more structured lines of poetry. The style, meant to evoke the sensation of poetry and prose at once, is fitting with the poem's theme, which is about the artist's struggle to create imaginative work or poetry when she is without basic (in other words, ""prosaic"" or unpoetical) needs such as shelter (an ""abode"" or a ""roof""), food, money, and physical freedom. ""Imagination"" is powered (""battery potency effusions"") by cosmic forces that guide the artist by way of her ""navel magnetical compass needle,"" her ""cosmos phallus."" This force makes the artist free from these more worldly concerns: her ""legs are unhitched to stray –flinty pavement free – for – nothing,"" until worldly needs press. Then, one must ""build – buy – abode – rent roof"" as an act of ""common sense,"" which is prosaic, ""sober,"" and responsible (a ""citizen"") and reliable, practical, and necessary for survival (like a ""map""). This contradiction is represented structurally by prose sections that read like long lines of poetry—""that feat demands expert steady mind –harsh clutch—sinister harlot smile"" juxtaposed with lines of text that look like poetry but either convey no new meaning (sometimes as one word that is part of the previous line such as ""Menacing"" or ""it"" in the example below), one word that is more like a misleading heading (such as ""Acruise"" or ""Behold""), or a complete line (such as ""There is no higher treasure"") that refers back to the prose section like some prophetic outburst.The contradiction that exists between prose and poetic language is juxtaposed in the poem just as the contradiction that exists between common sense and imagination and the need to eat and the need to create must become unified in the artist at the end of the ""Sermon."" In conclusion, poets become inherently contradictory as ""fragile demigods - teetering architects,"" who -""in tip-toe equilibrium's continuous peril"" are ""erecting word castles for world ideas,"" until these ""idealists in flesh - lightning rods [sic] inspired foils –quickened dirt"" who are ""unpaid - unhoused – unfed / realize: / absolutes demand for:/ concrete / abode."" Of course, for the Baroness, there is another contradiction at the heart of the poetic ideal: between creating art for art's sake and creating art for money. Thus, she dedicates (or ""desecrates"") the poem to ""Marcel"" (Marcel Duchamp) and to ""Carlos"" (William Carlos Williams) both of whom she denounces in life for becoming popular artists, for ""selling out"" to the public. Just as it is not the case that the Baroness's extant manuscripts are all in an unarranged state, of ""sixes and sevens"" (as Barnes wrote to Peter Whigham). Some of the Baroness's extant manuscripts may be easily arranged from rough draft to final version, sometimes with clear instructions from the poet on a final edit. For example, the Baroness writes in a letter to Marie Jolas at transition, ""I am worried by pestering [unclear] flea - ever since I sent you 'lifes beggartruth' that you will forget to put in 'numbskulledly""' in it's proper place – 'snooze in doldrums - numbskulledly defy current.'"" In this case, the Baroness has a final, published version in mind, at least for this line in a poem she never saw published, due in all probability to its length. In a letter to the Baroness from Marie Jolas, dated October 12, 1927, Jolas explains that they cannot use another long poem by the Baroness ""Contradictory Speculations"" because it is ""too long for our use"" though she does not mention ""Sermon on Life's Beggar Truth,"" a fact which prompts the Baroness to add at the end of her note about ""Sermon"": ""Of course - you have not yet accepted it - to my knowledge?""",Office of Digital Collections and Research,,Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven,,,,Tanya Clement,,North America|United States of America|Maryland|College Park,7 image; 6 witness,"Literature, Print Culture",eng,,,,umd_55453/umd_55455/tei.xml

There are ten extant versions (including the published text). Across the versions there are some phrases that remain more or less the same, some that change course and change back, and still others that evolve quite dramatically in a perceptive, linear fashion. In “Psychoanalytic Reading and the Avant-texte” Jean Bellemin-Noël sites “chance” as the salient element within the textual event that mollifies the need to reproduce temporality in the genetic edition. If we paraphrase his words, it is enough to engage temporal uncertainty and the element of chance by engaging space. He writes, ""we absolutely must substitute spatial metaphors for temporal images to avoid reintroducing the idea of teleology"" (Bellemin-Noël in Genetic Criticism. Ed. Jed Deppman, Daniel Ferrer, and Michael Groden. Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004: 31). For instance, in version three of “Xray,” readings (“Suns [sic] radioinfused soil,” “Radio’s soil secret,” “Radio’s sun message,” and “Radio’s sunimpregnated soil”) may be understood as alternative readings for the same point in a line of text because of their spatial arrangement on the manuscript page, all radiating around the word “soil.” In addition, since the text appears between the second and third line of text, it appears that the word cluster is a kind of brainstorming cluster that may or may not have helped the writer develop the phrase “Dumb radiopenetrated soil” that appears, for the first time in any version, on the line beneath the cluster. The difference between the text and the image and the dialogic these differences engage generates the element of temporal uncertainty that Bellemin-Noël requires. These deformations open a space for conversation (and play) between the digital surrogates at work (the images and the encoded texts) which, in turn, produces an environment, based on the underlying TEI encoding, that facilitates textual performance.",Office of Digital Collections and Research,,Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven,,,,Tanya Clement,,North America|United States of America|Maryland|College Park,9 image; 44 line; 10 witness,"Literature, Print Culture",eng,,,,umd_55458/umd_55459/tei.xml
